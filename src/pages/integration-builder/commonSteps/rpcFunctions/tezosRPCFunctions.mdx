title: Interacting with Tezos Blockchain
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Since Web3Auth doesn't have a native provider for Tezos, we need to directly use the private
key to make the RPC calls.

Using the function, `web3auth.provider.request({method: "private_key"})` from Web3Auth provider, the application can have access to the user's private
key. However, we cannot use this key with Tezos EC Curve specific signing functions, hence, we first derive the Tezos Key using the
`getTezosKeyPair()` function.
