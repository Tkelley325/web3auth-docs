title: Interacting with the Solana Blockchain
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Using this provider we can sign transactions and make RPC calls to Solana.

Additionally, You can use the `SolanaWallet` class from `@web3auth/solana-provider` package to use provider with. This class is a typed wrapper over
provider which we get after logging in with Web3Auth.

In this example we are using `SolanaWallet` wrapper to sign a transaction with connected web3 adapter.
