title: Interacting with the StarkEx Layer 2
---

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. Even though StarkEx is a layer 2 on Ethereum, it is not EVM compatible. Hence to use it, one
cannot use the native [`EIP1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) provider that Web3Auth gives for EVM blockchains. Hence we need to directly
use the private key to make the calls here.

Using the function, `web3auth.provider.request({method: "private_key"})` from Web3Auth provider, the application can have access to the user's private
key. However, we cannot use this key with StarkEx EC Curve specific signing functions, hence, we first derive the Stark Key using the `getStarkKey()`
function mentioned here.
