title: Triggering the login
---

Use the `connectTo` function of `web3auth` to navigate user to the login process. Since you're using `@web3auth/no-modal` you have the flexibility of
making your own UI and help user choose their preferred login method. For each login method, you have to select the adapter (like respective
`OPENLOGIN` for social logins) and/ or the `loginProvider` such as `google`, `facebook`, `twitch`, `jwt`, `email_passwordless` etc.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT` login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific method as mentioned here.

After a successful user login, the `web3auth` the function will return a provider which will be used to interact with the blockchain and sign
transactions. The app scoped private key can also be accessed from the provider as well.
