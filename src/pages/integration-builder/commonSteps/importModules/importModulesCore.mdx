title: Import the Web3Auth Modules into your project
---

**[`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/)**

This is the main Plug and Play No Modal package that contains the Web3AuthNoModal SDK helping you login users with their social accounts and
blockchain wallets, according to the chosen adapter. You have the flexibility of making your own UI and Web3Auth sits in the background.

**`@web3auth/base`**

Since we're using typescript, we need the base package to provide types of the different variables we'll be using throughout the app building process.
This reduces errors to a very large extent.

**Additionally, import the RPC file for your selected blockchain.**
