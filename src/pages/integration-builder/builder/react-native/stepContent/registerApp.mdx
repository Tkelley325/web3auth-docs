In order to use Web3Auth, you'll need to create a project in the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and get your client ID.

> This is not required on localhost enviroment, however, we recommend creating a project in the dashboard for testing purposes in a hosted demo
> application. While moving to a production environment, make sure to convert your project to `mainnet`, `aqua`, or `cyan`, otherwise you'll end up
> losing users and keys.

- Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), create or select a Web3Auth project.

- You can also enable interoperability options within the project while initialising it.

- Add your `redirectUrl` to **Whitelist URLs**.

- Copy the `Client ID` and paste it here, it will be used during instantiation.
