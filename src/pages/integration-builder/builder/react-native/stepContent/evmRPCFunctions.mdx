title: Interacting with a Blockchain

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns their reconstructed private key. For EVM Blockchains, the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign
transactions. We also return an `ed25519` compatible private key for other blockchains. Similar to how we're using this private key in the `ethers.js`
library in this example, you can connect to any other blockchain of your choice.

Please go through the [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/ethereum/react-native) Documentation, which contains all the details of the EVM based
blockchain you have selected here.
