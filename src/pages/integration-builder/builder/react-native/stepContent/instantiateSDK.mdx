title: Create the Web3Auth instance
---

It's time to create an instance of Web3Auth in the project.

We need `clientId` and target Web3Auth `network` to initialize the `web3auth` object.

- You can get your `clientId` from registering (above) on the Developer Dashboard.

- `network` signifies the network on which the deployed Web3Auth nodes are running. For testing purposes, we have a `TESTNET` network. For production
  usage, you can use the `CYAN`, `MAINNET`, & `AQUA` networks.

  :::danger

  Please don't use the `TESTNET` network for production usage. You may end up losing user keys.
