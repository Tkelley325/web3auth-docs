title: Custom Authentication
---

Custom Authentication is a way to authenticate users with your own custom authentication service like Auth0, Firebase Authentication etc.

For enabling this, you need [Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the
[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration. You can then configure your `Web3Auth` instance with
the `loginConfig` parameter.
