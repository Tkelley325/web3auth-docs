title: Triggering the login
---

Use the `login` function of `web3auth` to navigate user to the login process. For each login method, you have to select the `loginProvider` such as
`google`, `facebook`, `twitch`, `jwt`, `email_passwordless` etc.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT` login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific method as mentioned here.

:::

Once a user logs in, the Web3Auth SDK returns their reconstructed private key. For EVM Blockchains, the `secp256k1` private key is used to sign
transactions. We also return an `ed25519` compatible private key for other blockchains.
