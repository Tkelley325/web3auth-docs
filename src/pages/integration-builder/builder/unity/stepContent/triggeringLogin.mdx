title: Triggering the login
---

The `web3Auth.login()` function helps your user to trigger the login process. The login flow will be triggered based on the selected provider. You can
view the list of selected providers in the [provider](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/pnp/unity/usage#provider) section of SDK Reference such as GOOGLE,
FACEBOOK, TWITTER, EMAIL_PASSWORDLESS, etc. `web3Auth.login()` requires `LoginParams()` as a required input.

If you are using the `email_passwordless` login provider, you will also have to specify the email address as `login_hint` in the `extraLoginOptions`
as well.
