title: Whitelabeling
---

Web3Auth is fully whitelabelable with application branding to have a consistent user experience. For defining custom UI, branding, and translations
for your brand app, you just need to specify an additional parameter within the `Web3AuthOptions` Object called `whiteLabel`. This parameter takes
another object called `WhiteLabelData`.
