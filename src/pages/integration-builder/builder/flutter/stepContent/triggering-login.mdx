title: Triggering the login
---

Call the `login()` method on the `Web3AuthFlutter` instance to trigger the login flow. You should pass the `loginProvider` parameter to specify the
provider you wish to use.

:::info JWT

If you are using custom authentication through **Auth0 or Custom JWT**, you have to use the `JWT` login provider.

Additionally, in `extraLoginOptions` you have to provide the details required by that specific method as mentioned here.
