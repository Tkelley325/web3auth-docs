To use this HTML/JS Quick Start Guide, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and add them to your application, or simply
copy paste the entire files and run them on your own.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the [Web3Auth Community](https://web3auth.io/community/) for us to help you out as soon as
possible!

:::tip building locally

- Copy the content of `index.html`, `style.css ` into a folder & add your blockchain specific `.js` file.
- Navigate to the folder and run the app in a local server using

  ```bash
  http-server -p 8888
  ```

- If you don't have `http-server` installed, install using npm or Yarn:

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install -g http-server
  ```
