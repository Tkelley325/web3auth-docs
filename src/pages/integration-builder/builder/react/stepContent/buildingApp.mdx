To use this React Quick Start Guide, you can either study the steps and the different snippets of code and add them to your application, or simply
copy paste the entire files and run them on your own.

If you face any problem anytime, you can always refer to the [Web3Auth Discussions Page](https://github.com/Web3Auth/Web3Auth/discussions) for us to

    { label: "npx", value: "npx" },
    { label: "Yarn", value: "yarn" },
  ]}
  >
  <TabItem value="npx">

  ```shell
  npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
  ```

    </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

  ```shell
  yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
  ```

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>
