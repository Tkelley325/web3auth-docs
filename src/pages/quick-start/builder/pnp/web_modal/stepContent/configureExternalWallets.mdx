title: Configure External Wallets [Optional]
---

To configure external wallets in your application, you can use the `getDefaultExternalAdapters`
function provided by `@web3auth/default-evm-adapter` package. This function automatically:

- Discovers and returns all compatible wallets present in the user's browser through wallet
  discovery
- Includes WalletConnect compatible wallets in the list of available options

This makes it simple to enable multiple wallet connection options without having to manually
configure each wallet adapter.
