title: Instantiate Web3Auth Config
---

For using Web3Auth state within your application, you need to make an instance, which is further
provided to the hooks/ composables SDK. The SDK further manages the Web3Auth state and exposes ready
to use functions to call from anywhere in your application.

For instantiating Web3Auth PnP Modal SDK, you need to provide your Client ID, the Web3Auth Network
of your project and the configuration of the chain you're looking to connect to. Additionally, you
can configure extenal wallet adapters within the application as well.
