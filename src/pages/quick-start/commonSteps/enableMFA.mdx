title: Enable MFA for the User [Optional]
---

You can enable the MFA for the user and make the keys self-custodial. This is an optional step and
can be skipped if you don't want.

The Enable MFA option popup up the https://auth.web3auth.io website where the user can set up
different additional factors like secondary social login, email, or phone number, authenticator,
passkeys, etc.
