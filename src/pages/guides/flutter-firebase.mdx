In this guide, we'll talk about how we can use Web3Auth Flutter SDK with Firebase in your Flutter
application.

As an overview, the guide is quite simple, with functionality to log in, display user details, and
perform blockchain interactions. The signing of the blockchain transactions is done through the
Web3Auth embedded wallet. You can check out the infrastructure docs,
["Web3Auth Wallet Management Infrastructure"](/docs/infrastructure) for a high-level overview of the
Web3Auth architecture and implementation. For those who want to skip straight to the code, you can
find it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/flutter/flutter-firebase-example).

## How to set up Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

## How to set up Firebase for Flutter

If you haven't already setup the Firebase for your Flutter app, please setup the Firebase, as it's
the prerequisites for the guide. Head to the
[Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) for the details
instructions.

## How to set up Custom Verifer

Once, you have set up the Web3Auth Dashboard, created a new project, and set up Firebase, it's time
to create a Custom Verifier for your Firebase application. We already have detail instructions on
how to create a Custom Verifier for Firebase, please head to our
[documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/auth-provider-setup/authentication-service-providers/firebase-service-provider).

## Integrating Web3Auth SDK in Flutter

Once, you have set up the Custom Verifier, it's time to integrate Web3Auth in your Flutter
application. For the implementation, we'll use the
[web3auth_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/web3auth_flutter). This SDK facilitates integration with
Web3Auth, and allows you to easily manage embedded wallet in your Flutter application.

### Installation

To install the web3auth_flutter package, you have two options. You can either manually add the
package in the `pubspec.yaml` file, or you can use the `flutter pub add` command.

<Tabs defaultValue = "console"
  values={[
    { label: "Console", value: "console", },
    { label: "Pubspec", value: "pubspec", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="console">
Add `web3auth_flutter` using `flutter pub add` command.

```sh
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pubspec">
Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

<PubspecInstallation />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Initialization

After successfully installing the package, the next step is to initialize Web3Auth in your Flutter
app. This sets up the necessary configurations using Client Id and prepares Web3Auth.
[Learn more about Web3Auth Initialization](/docs/sdk/pnp/flutter/initialize).

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters
according to the preference of your project. Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication
have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customise your Web3Auth Instance.

```dart
// focus-next-line
import 'package:web3auth_flutter/web3auth_flutter.dart';

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  initPlatformState();
}

Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
  final Uri redirectUrl;
  if (Platform.isAndroid) {
    redirectUrl = Uri.parse('{SCHEME}://{HOST}/auth');
  } else if (Platform.isIOS) {
    redirectUrl = Uri.parse('{bundleId}://auth');
  } else {
    throw UnKnownException('Unknown platform');
  }

  // focus-start
  final loginConfig = HashMap<String, LoginConfigItem>();

  loginConfig['jwt'] = LoginConfigItem(
    verifier: "VERIFIER_NAME", // get it from web3auth dashboard
    typeOfLogin: TypeOfLogin.jwt,
    name: "Firebase JWT Login",
    clientId: "WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // web3auth's plug and play client id
  );

  await Web3AuthFlutter.init(
    Web3AuthOptions(
      clientId:'YOUR WEB3AUTH CLIENT ID FROM DASHBOARD',
      network: Network.cyan,
      redirectUri: redirectUrl,
      loginConfig: loginConfig,
    )
  );
    // focus-end

  await Web3AuthFlutter.initialize();
}
```

### Authentication

If the user is not authenticated, you should utilize the `login` method. For the example, we'll use
the Firebase `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method to authorize user, and retrive the JWT token. This
token, then can be used as input for Web3Auth login. We'll create a helper function `_withJWT`
method. The login method is pretty straightforward, it authorizes user using Firebase, and uses the
Firebase id token to login in Web3Auth. To pass the JWT token from the Firebase, we'll use
`ExtraLoginOptions`.

Learn more about [Web3Auth LoginParams](/docs/sdk/pnp/flutter/usage#arguments).

```dart
Future<Web3AuthResponse> _withJWT() async {
  String idToken = "";
  try {
    final credential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
      email: 'custom+id_token@firebase.login',
      password: 'Welcome@W3A',
    );

    idToken = await credential.user?.getIdToken(true) ?? '';
  } on FirebaseAuthException catch (e) {
    if (e.code == 'user-not-found') {
      log('No user found for that email.');
    } else if (e.code == 'wrong-password') {
      log('Wrong password provided for that user.');
    }
  }

  // focus-start
  return Web3AuthFlutter.login(
    LoginParams(
      loginProvider: Provider.jwt,
      extraLoginOptions: ExtraLoginOptions(
        id_token: idToken,
        domain: 'firebase',
      ),
    ),
  );
   // focus-end
}
```

### Logout

To logout the existing user, we'll simply use the `logout` method of Web3AuthFlutter.

```dart
VoidCallback _logout() {
  return () async {
    try {
      // focus-next-line
      await Web3AuthFlutter.logout();
      setState(() {
        _result = '<empty>';
        logoutVisible = false;
      });
    } on UserCancelledException {
      print("User cancelled.");
    } on UnKnownException {
      print("Unknown exception occurred");
    }
  };
}
```

## Set up Blockchain Providers

Once we have successfully authenticated the user, the next step would be to fetch the user details,
retrieve wallet address and prepare blockchain providers for interactions. For this guide, we are
supporting only Ethereum ecosystem, but the general idea can be used for any blockchain ecosystem.

For interacting with ethereum chains, we'll use the [web3dart](https://pub.dev/packages/web3dart)
SDK. To install the web3dart package, you have two options. You can either manually add the package
in the `pubspec.yaml` file, or you can use the `flutter pub add` command.

<Tabs defaultValue = "console"
  values={[
    { label: "Console", value: "console", },
    { label: "Pubspec", value: "pubspec", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="console">
Add `web3dart` using `flutter pub add` command.

```sh
flutter pub add web3dart
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pubspec">
Add `web3dart` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3dart: ^2.7.3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After successfully installing package, it's time to create `Credentials` instance to retrive user's
EOA address, and sign the transactions. To retrive the user's private key, we'll use the
`getPrivateKey` method.

```dart
final privateKey = await Web3AuthFlutter.getPrivKey();
final Credentials credentials = EthPrivateKey.fromHex(privateKey);

// User's EOA address
log(credentials.address)
```

To retrive user's balance, and interacting with Blockcahin, you can follow our detailed guide on how
to [interact with EVM chain guides](/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/flutter#get-balance).
Since, you already have created `Credentials` instance, and retrived the user's EOA address, you can
skip that part. To interact with Solana blockchain, you can checkout our
[Solana blockchain guide](/docs/connect-blockchain/solana/flutter).
