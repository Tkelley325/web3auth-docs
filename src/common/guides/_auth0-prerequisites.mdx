- Create an Auth0 tenant and configure a Single Page Web Application (SPA for Web) or Native (for Mobile) from
  [Auth0 Console](https://manage.auth0.com/).

- Please note that Regular Web Applications are also supported as mentioned in the flows above. However, for this guide, we prefer SPA since its
  implicit flow doesnâ€™t require an application to host a backend server.
