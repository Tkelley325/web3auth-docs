![Web3Auth - Firebase Login Flow](/images/firebase-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with `Firebase`, Firebase sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self-custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.
