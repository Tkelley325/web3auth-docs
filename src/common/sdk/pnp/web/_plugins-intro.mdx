Plugins are essentially extensions to the core functionality of Web3Auth, allowing you to add
additional features to your dApp. These features can be used to extend the UI functionalities,
making your integration more interoperable, and a lot more, even having the functionality to be
customised extremely and to your liking.

:::tip

Refer to the [Wallet Services Plugin Documentation](/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/) to know more
deeply about how you utilise our plugins to extend the functionality of your dApp.

:::

```javascript
import { WalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin";

const walletServicesPlugin = new WalletServicesPlugin();

web3auth.addPlugin(walletServicesPlugin); // Add the plugin to web3auth
```
