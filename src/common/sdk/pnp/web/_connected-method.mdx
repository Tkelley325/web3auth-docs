:::tip

If you're using the `uxMode: "redirect"` option within your configuration, you need to check this
event to handle the logging in implicitly. This is because, when redirected to a different
application, the app state is not updated as per the login status.

Using this method, you can check if the user is connected and update the app state accordingly
within the constructor.
