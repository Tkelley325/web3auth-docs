#### `provider`

Returns the private key provider connected to the `web3auth` instance.

#### Returns

```js
provider: IProvider | null;
```

- If a user is connected, it will return the provider instance connected to the user.
- If no user is connected, however, the initialisation of the `web3auth` instance is done, it will
  return the provider instance, however the provider cannot be used for any operations.
- If no user is connected and the `web3auth` instance is not initialised, it will return a `null`
  value.
