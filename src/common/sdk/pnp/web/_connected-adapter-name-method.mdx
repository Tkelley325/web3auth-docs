#### `connectedAdapterName`

This function gives you the name of the connected adapter. This can be used to check which adapter
is connected to the user.

```javascript
const adapter = web3auth.connectedAdapterName;
```

#### Returns

```javascript
connectedAdapterName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE | null;

export type WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE = (typeof WALLET_ADAPTERS)[keyof typeof WALLET_ADAPTERS];

export declare const WALLET_ADAPTERS: {
  AUTH: string;
  WALLET_CONNECT_V2: string;
  SFA: string;
  TORUS_SOLANA: string;
  TORUS_EVM: string;
  COINBASE: string;
};
```

- If a user is connected, it will return the name of the adapter via which the login has happened.
- If connecting via MIPD (EIP6163) in default evm/ solana adapters, it will return the name of the
  wallet connected.
- If no user is connected, this function will return a `null` value.
