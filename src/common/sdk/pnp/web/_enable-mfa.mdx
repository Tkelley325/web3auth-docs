#### `enableMFA()`

You can enable Multi Factor Authentication for the user by calling the `enableMFA()` function. This
function will trigger a redirect to the MFA setup page, where the user will be asked to login again
and set up the MFA Methods according to the configuration set in the `web3auth` instance.

```javascript
await web3auth.enableMFA();
```

#### Interface

```js
enableMFA<T>(loginParams?: T): Promise<void>;
```
