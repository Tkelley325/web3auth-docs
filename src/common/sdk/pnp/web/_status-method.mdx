#### `status`

Returns the current status of the `web3auth` instance.

```javascript
const status = web3auth.status;
```

An adapter emits certain events like `CONNECTED`, `CONNECTING` and `DISCONNECTED` etc during login
lifecycle of a user. Knowing to events help you trigger responses based on the status of the
connection of the user. For example, you can use this to show an error message, if the user is not
connected to the network.

Web3Auth provides the following lifecycle event to check the login status:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="table"
  values={[
    { label: "Table", value: "table" },
    { label: "Type Declarations", value: "type" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="table">

| Event        | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOT_READY`  | Triggered when the adapter is not ready.                   |
| `READY`      | Triggered when the adapter is ready.                       |
| `CONNECTING` | Triggered when the user is connecting to the wallet.       |
| `CONNECTED`  | Triggered when the user is connected to the wallet.        |
| `ERRORED`    | Triggered when an error occurs during the login lifecycle. |
