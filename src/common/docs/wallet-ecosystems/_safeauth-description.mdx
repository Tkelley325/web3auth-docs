The SafeAuth Kit, designed in collaboration with Safe, offers a transformative approach to integrating smart wallets with your application, ensuring
compatibility with ERC-4337 and leveraging the principles of Account Abstraction. This innovative solution utilizes Web3Auth's MPC-powered accounts as
the signer for these smart wallets, facilitating a smooth onboarding and recovery process. By doing so, it not only simplifies the user experience by
streamlining their interaction with the blockchain but also enhances security and user autonomy.
