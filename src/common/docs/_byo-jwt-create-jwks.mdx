Once you have created the script to sign the JWT, it's time to convert `publicKey.pem` file to
`jwk(s)` format. One of the tool you can use to convert is https://pem2jwk.vercel.app/.

- Select the correct signing algorithm: `RS256`
- Select Public Key use: `Signing`
- Key ID: `paste-your` or leave it blank to generate a random one.
- PEM encoded key: `{paste-the-publicKey-pem-file-s-content-here}`
- Click on the `Convert to JWK` button.

To complete the process, you need to save the output as a `.json` file, host it on your server, and
make sure it's publicly accessible. This will give you the `JWKS Endpoint`, which is required when
setting up a `Custom JWT Verifier` on the Web3Auth Dashboard.
