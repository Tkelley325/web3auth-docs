Authentication Service Providers enable you to use some implicit and authorization code grants. You
could also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity providers to select other Social
providers (e.g.: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively supported by
us. Note: This will require you to register an app with the Authentication Service Providers.
