The Multi Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them login into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

You can set the mfaLevel within the `web3auth.login()` to customize when mfa screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`default`** - Setting the mfaLevel to default will present the MFA screen to user on every third login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.DEFAULT`
- **`optional`** - Setting mfaLevel to optional will present the MFA screen to user on every login but user will have the option to skip it.
  `mfaLevel = MFALevel.OPTIONAL`
- **`mandatory`** - Setting mfaLevel to mandatory will make it mandatory for user to setup MFA after login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.MANDATORY`
- **`none`** - Setting mfaLevel to none will skip the mfa setup screen totally. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.NONE`

```tsx
export const MFA_LEVELS = {
  DEFAULT: "default",
  OPTIONAL: "optional",
  MANDATORY: "mandatory",
  NONE: "none",
};
```

## Example

```tsx
const state = await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
  // highlight-next-line
  mfaLevel: MFALevel.MANDATORY, // MFALevel.DEFAULT, MFALevel.OPTIONAL, MFALevel.MANDATORY, MFALevel.NONE
});
```
