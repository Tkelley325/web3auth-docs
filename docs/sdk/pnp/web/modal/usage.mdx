Once you've installed and successfully initialized Web3Auth, you can use it to authenticate your
users. Further, you can use the native provider given by Web3Auth to connect the users to the
respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3Auth` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the
following functions:

- `connect()` - Showing the Modal and Logging in the User
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `enableMFA()` - Enable Multi Factor Authentication for the user
- `manageMFA()` - Redirect the user to manage their MFA settings in the Web3Auth Account Dashboard
- `authenticateUser()` - Getting the idToken from Web3Auth
- `addChain()` - Add chain config details to the connected adapter.
- `switchChain()` - Switch chain as per chainId already added to chain config.
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

Additionally the following methods are available to get information about the current state of the
instance:

- `connected` - Returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is connected or not.
- `status` - Returns the current status of the web3auth instance.
- `provider` - Returns the currently connected provider to the web3auth instance.
- `connectedAdapterName` - Returns the currently connected provider to the web3auth instance.

Finally, with the Wallet Services Plugin, you can enable additional functionalities like:

- `showCheckout()` - Initiate Topup for the user.
- `showWalletConnectScanner()` - Show WalletConnect QR Code Scanner.
- `showWalletUI()` - Show Embedded Wallet UI.
- `showSwap()` - Show Swap UI.
- `showTransactionConfirmation()` - Show Transaction Confirmation UI.

## Logging in the User

You can show the modal in the browser by calling `connect()` function on `web3auth` instance. Your
user can choose their preferred login method and access your application.

```javascript
await web3auth.connect();
```

#### Returns

```tsx
connect(): Promise<IProvider | null>;
```

- On successful login, the `connect()` function returns a `IProvider` instance. This instance
  contains the respective provider corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this
  provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.
- On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

### Show WalletConnect Scanner

You can use the `showWalletConnectScanner` function to show the Wallet Connect Scanner, and connect
with dApps having Wallet Connect login option. This is useful for interoperability with dApps having
Wallet Connect login option.
[Learn more about `showWalletConnectScanner`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#connect-dapps-with-wallet-connect).

### Fiat On Ramp

You can use the `showCheckout` function to show the TopUp modal, allowing users to select their
local currency and specify the token to top up their wallet.
[Learn more about `showCheckout`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#fiat-on-ramp).

### Embedded Wallet UI

You can use the `showWalletUI` function to show the templated wallet UI services.
[Learn more about `showWalletUI`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#show-wallet-embedded-ui).

### Swap Screen

You can use the `showSwap` function to show the Swap UI.
[Learn more about `showSwap`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#swap).

### Transaction Confirmation Screen

You can use the wallet services provider to integrate prebuilt transaction confirmation screens into
your application. Upon successful completion, you can retrieve the signature for the request.
