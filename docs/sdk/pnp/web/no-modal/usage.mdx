Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthNoModal`, you can use it to authenticate
your users. Further, you can use the native provider given by `Web3AuthNoModal` to connect the users
to the respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3AuthNoModal` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns
the following functions:

- `connectTo()` - Logging in the User with the given Wallet Adapter and respective Login Parameters.
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information.
- `enableMFA()` - Enable Multi Factor Authentication for the user.
- `manageMFA()` - Redirect users to the Web3Auth Account Dashboard to manage their MFA settings.
- `authenticateUser()` - Getting the idToken from Web3Auth.
- `addChain()` - Add chain config details to the connected adapter.
- `switchChain()` - Switch chain as per chainId already added to the chain config.
- `logout()` - Logging out the User.
- `getAdapter()` - Retrieve a specific wallet adapter by its name.
- `configureAdapter()` - Configure a new or existing adapter.
- `clearCache()` - Clear cached session information.

Additionally, the following methods and properties are available to get or modify information about
the current state of the instance:

- `connected` - Returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is connected or not.
- `status` - Returns the current status of the web3auth instance.
- `provider` (getter/setter) - Returns or sets the currently connected provider to the web3auth
  instance.
- `connectedAdapterName` - Returns the name of the currently connected adapter.

You can also extend functionality by using the following plugin management functions:

- `addPlugin()` - Add a plugin to extend the functionality of the Web3Auth instance.
- `getPlugin()` - Retrieve an added plugin by name.

Finally, with the Wallet Services Plugin, you can enable additional functionalities like:

- `showWalletUI()` - Show Wallet UI Screen.
- `initiateTopup()` - Initiate Topup for the user.
- `showWalletConnectScanner()` - Show WalletConnect QR Code Scanner.

## Logging in the User

<ConnectTo />

#### Returns

```tsx
connectTo<T>(walletName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE, loginParams?: T): Promise<IProvider | null>;
```

- On successful login, the `connectTo()` function returns a `IProvider` instance. This instance
  contains the respective provider corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this
  provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

- On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

### Usage

<ConnectToExample />

:::tip

You can use the `connectTo()` function to connect to the custom authentication verifiers you might
have deployed on the Web3Auth Dashboard, as well as the default ones that Web3Auth provides. For the
default verifiers, you don't need to provide any additional parameters, just pass on the login
provider type.

[Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/providers).

### Wallet Adapter Name

#### `walletName`

<WalletAdapters />

### Login Parameters

#### `loginParams`

The `loginParams` are specific for each and every function. Please refer to the
[Adapters SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters) to know more about the login parameters specific to
each wallet adapter.

For `auth-adapter` which enables social logins, you can refer to the following `loginParams`.

<AuthLoginParams />

Further, for Custom Authentication, `ExtraLoginOptions` can be used to pass the standard OAuth login
options.

<ExtraLoginOptions />

## Check if the user is connected

<Connected />

## Check which adapter is connected

<ConnectedAdapterName />

## Get the connected provider

<Provider />

## Know the current status of the instance

<Status />

## Get User's Information

<GetUserInfo />

## Enable Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

<EnableMFA />

## Manage Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

<ManageMFA />

## Get idToken

<GetIdTokenInfo />

## Add Chain

<AddChain />

## Switch Chain

<SwitchChain />

## Logging out the User

<LogOut />

## Connecting to a Blockchain

<ConnectBlockchain />

## Fetching the Connected Adapter

<ConnectedAdapterName />

## Wallet Services Plugin Methods

You can use the Wallet Services Plugin to enable additional functionalities like showing the Wallet
UI Screen, Wallet Connect Scanner, and initiating topup for the user.

[Wallet Services SDK Reference](../wallet-services/).

### Show WalletConnect Scanner

You can use the `showWalletConnectScanner` function to show the Wallet Connect Scanner, and connect
with dApps having Wallet Connect login option. This is useful for interoperability with dApps having
Wallet Connect login option.
[Learn more about `showWalletConnectScanner`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#connect-dapps-with-wallet-connect).

### Fiat On Ramp

You can use the `showCheckout` function to show the TopUp modal, allowing users to select their
local currency and specify the token to top up their wallet.
[Learn more about `showCheckout`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#fiat-on-ramp).

### Embedded Wallet UI

You can use the `showWalletUI` function to show the templated wallet UI services.
[Learn more about `showWalletUI`](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#show-wallet-embedded-ui).

### Transaction Confirmatons Screen

You can use the wallet services provider to integrate prebuilt transaction confirmation screens into
your application. Upon successful completion, you can retrieve the signature for the request.
[Learn more about transaction confirmation screens](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/wallet-services/usage#transaction-confirmation-screens).
