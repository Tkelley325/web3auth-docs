Whitelabeling is a pivotal feature of Web3Auth that empowers developers to offer a seamless and
cohesive user experience across their applications. Through customization of the user interface,
branding, and translations, Web3Auth's whitelabeling capabilities ensure that every aspect of the
authentication flow aligns with your application's identity.

#### Steps for Customization

1. **Choose Your SDK:** Decide between Plug and Play, SFA & MPC Core Kit SDKs based on your needs
   for customization and control.

   :::info

   With Single Factor Auth & MPC Core Kit SDKs, Web3Auth is invisible to the user, and you have the
   complete control over the user interface, branding, and translations.

   :::

2. **Define Your Branding:** While using Plug and Play SDKs, you can customize the elements of the
   SDKs, such as modals, screens, and logos, to align with your branding guidelines.
3. **Apply Translations:** Tailor the language and translations within the authentication flow to
   cater to your target audience.
