title: Multi Injected Provider Discovery

Web3Auth have capability to discover, and interact with various injected wallets seamlessly. This
feature is known as Multi Injected Provider Discovery. It's is a standard that Web3Auth follows to
identify and interact with various wallet providers that inject themselves into the browser's window
object.

This feature is particularly useful in environments where multiple wallets might be present, such as
browser extensions. It provides a more flexible and user-friendly experience for applications that
support Ethereum or Solana ecosystems.

MIPD for Ethereum compatible wallets follows the [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963)
standard. It uses a new event-based system for provider discovery where wallets announce their
presence by emitting a event. These events can be listened by dApps to discover available providers.

MIPD for Solana wallets follows the
[Wallet Standard for Solana](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard/blob/master/extensions/solana.md).
Wallet Standard is a set of interfaces and conventions designed to improve the user experience for
wallets.

## Key features of MIPD

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can choose their preferred wallet from multiple options.
2. **Broader Wallet Support**: Your dApp can interact with a wide range of wallets without
   additional configuration.
3. **Ecosystem Flexibility**: Supports both Ethereum compatible chains and Solana ecosystem,
   catering to a wider audience.

## Implementing MIPD in Your Application

You can start using MIPD feature in your application by simply configuring adapters for Web3Auth PnP
Web SDKs. For EVM based applications, you can simply use the
[default EVM adapter](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/default-evm-adapter), and for Solana based
applications you can use the
[default Solana adapter](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/default-solana-adapter).
