Smart accounts powered by Web3Auth's native account abstraction represent the next generation of
blockchain wallets. These accounts are deployed through CREATE2Factory and implement the ERC-4337
standard, enabling sophisticated transaction handling while maintaining a seamless user experience.

At their core, smart accounts contain essential validation logic through the `validateUserOp`
function, which verifies UserOperations when triggered by the EntryPoint contract. This architecture
allows for powerful features while maintaining security and user control.

To begin implementing smart accounts in your application using Web3Auth's native account
abstraction, refer to our detailed guide on
[Web3Auth with Account Abstraction](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/providers/aa-provider).

## Features of Smart Accounts

### Transaction Batching

Smart accounts revolutionize transaction handling by enabling multiple operations to be executed in
a single call. Unlike traditional EOA wallets that require separate approvals and transactions,
smart accounts can combine multiple actions efficiently. For example, when swapping tokens, users
can approve and execute the swap in one transaction, significantly improving the user experience and
reducing gas costs. Learn more about implementing
[batch transactions with Smart Contract Wallets](/docs/sdk/pnp/web/providers/aa-provider#send-batch-transaction).

### Advanced Gas Management

Smart accounts address one of the major barriers to blockchain adoption - gas fees. Through
integration with paymasters, these accounts can implement sophisticated gas management strategies.
Users can have their transaction fees sponsored by applications, or pay fees using ERC-20 tokens
like USDC instead of the chain's native currency. This flexibility makes blockchain interactions
more accessible to newcomers and provides better options for experienced users.

### Programmable Logic

Smart accounts introduce unprecedented levels of programmability to wallet functionality. Developers
can implement custom logic for:

- Automated trading strategies based on market conditions
- Sophisticated spending controls and limits
- Multi-signature security schemes
- Custom validation rules and security measures

These programmable features allow for the creation of highly specialized wallet behaviors that can
adapt to specific user needs or application requirements.
