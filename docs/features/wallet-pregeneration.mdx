Pre-generated wallets are a key feature of Web3Auth, aimed at simplifying user onboarding. This
functionality enables developers to generate both EOA wallet addresses and Smart Accounts (ERC-4337)
for users before their first login. By providing this flexibility, you can tailor when and how users
are introduced to wallet functionalities, ultimately enhancing their experience and boosting
engagement.

## Capabilities of Pre-generated Wallets

The ability to pre-generate wallets unlocks diverse use cases, making it seamless to integrate Web3
features into your application's user journey:

1. **Early Wallet Creation**: Create wallets during the user invite or onboarding process, even
   before their first login, ensuring a smoother start to their Web3 experience.
2. **Deferred Login Setup**: Postpone wallet access management, such as OAuth logins or passkeys,
   until the user is ready to perform their first on-chain transaction, reducing initial friction.
3. **Wallet Prefunding**: Incentivize users by preloading wallets with token rewards for off-chain
   activities, enabling them to easily claim these rewards upon accessing their pre-generated
   wallet.

:::note

Access to Wallet Pregeneration is gated. You can use this feature in `sapphire_devnet` for free. The
minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this feature in a production
environment is the **Scale Plan**.

## Pre-generate EOA Wallets

Web3Auth provides a straightforward API to facilitate the creation of pre-generated EOA wallets. You
can integrate this API into your user signup flow, either after a user verifies their email or
independently by supplying their email or unique identifier to the API.

:::warning

This API only returns the Core Kit Key wallet addresses. To use the wallet addresses with the
Web3Auth SDKs, you will need to either use the `useCoreKitKey` flag in our PnP SDKs or use any of
our Single Factor Auth SDKs

[keys can change within different Web3Auth Products](/docs/troubleshooting/different-private-key#product)

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Users:** Determine the unique identifier or email for the user within your system.
   This will be the `verifierId` used to create the wallet.
2. **API Call:** Use the provided API to submit the user's identifier. You'll need to specify
   parameters from the Web3Auth dashboard, specifically the Verifier Name, Web3Auth Network, and
   Client Id.
3. **Receive Wallet Address:** The API response will include the new wallet address, ready for use
   by the user upon their first login.
