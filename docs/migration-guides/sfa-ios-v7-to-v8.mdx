This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v7 to v8 of the SFA iOS SDK. The
guide outlines significant changes and enhancements.

## Breaking Changes

### Changes in SingleFactorAuth Constructor

In v8, we try to improve the developer experience by renaming the parameter and
`SingleFactorAuthArgs` class, and introducing a new parameter for session management.

- `singleFactorAuthArgs` used to initialize the SingleFactorAuth SDK has been renamed to
  `sfaParams`. It has been renamed to align the naming conventions across Web3Auth SDKs.

#### SingleFactorAuthArgs Changes

- `SingleFactorAuthArgs` is now renamed to `SFAParams`. It has been renamed to align with naming
  conventions across Web3Auth SDKs.
- `sessionTime` was added to specify session duration in seconds. By default, the value is set to
  86400 seconds (1 day), with a maximum session duration of up to 30 days

```swift
// remove-next-line
let arguments = SingleFactorAuthArgs(
// add-next-line
let singleFactorAuthArgs = SFAParams(
    web3AuthClientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    network: .sapphire(.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET)
)

// remove-next-line
let singleFactoreAuth = SingleFactorAuth(singleFactorAuthArgs: singleFactorAuthArgs)
// add-next-line
let singleFactoreAuth = SingleFactorAuth(params: SFAParams)
```

### TorusSFAKey is renamed to SFAKey

In v8, the `TorusSFAKey` is now removed. Developers can now use `SFAKey` to access the private key
and address for the account. It was renamed to maintain consistency across SDKs.

### `getKey` method is renamed to `connect`

In v8, the `getKey` method is renamed to `connect`. This change was done to improve the developer
experience and align with other Web3Auth SFA SDKs.

```swift
let loginParams = LoginParams(
    verifier: "YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME",
    verifierId: "VERIFIER_ID",
    idToken: "ID_TOKEN"
)

// focus-start
// remove-next-line
let torusKey: TorusSFAKey = try await singleFactoreAuth.getKey(loginParams: loginParams)
// add-next-line
let sfaKey: SFAKey = try await singleFactoreAuth.connect(loginParams: loginParams)
// focus-end
```
