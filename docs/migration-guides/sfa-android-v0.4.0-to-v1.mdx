description: "SFA Android SDK - v0.4.0 to v1 | Documentation - Web3Auth"
sidebar_label: v0.4.0 to v1
---

This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v0.4.0 to v1 of the SFA Android SDK.
The guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of Web3Auth's
Sapphire network support.

## Breaking Changes

### Changes in SingleFactorAuth Constructor

In v8, we try to improve the developer experience by renaming the parameter and
`SingleFactorAuthArgs` class, and introducing a new parameter for session management.

- `singleFactorAuthArgs` used to initialize the SingleFactorAuth SDK has been renamed to
  `sfaParams`. It has been renamed to align the naming conventions across Web3Auth SDKs.
- `context` was added to specific the application's context.

### Changes in SingleFactorAuthArgs Changes

- `SingleFactorAuthArgs` is now renamed to `SFAParams`. It has been renamed to align with naming
  conventions across Web3Auth SDKs.
- `sessionTime` was added to specify session duration in seconds. By default, the value is set to
  86400 seconds (1 day), with a maximum session duration of up to 30 days.
- `serverTimeOffset` was added to specify a custom server time offset. The default value is 0

```kotlin
// remove-next-line
val params = SingleFactorAuthArgs(
// add-next-line
val params = SFAParams(
  Web3AuthNetwork.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID"
)

val singleFactorAuth = SingleFactorAuth(
  singleFactorAuthArgs,
  // add-next-line
  this,
)


```

### TorusKey is renamed to SFAKey

In v1, the `TorusKey` is now removed. Developers can now use `SFAKey` to access the private key and
address for the account. It was renamed to maintain consistency across SDKs.

### Deprecation of authentication methods

In v1, the `getKey` method is deprecated. Developers can now use `connect`, the common method for
single verifier and aggregate verifier login. This change was done to improve the developer
experience and align with other Web3Auth SFA SDKs.

```kotlin
val loginParams = LoginParams(
  "YOUR_VERIFIER_NAME",
  "YOUR_VERIFIER_ID_VALUE",
  "YOUR_ID_TOKEN"
);

// remove-next-line
val torusKey = singleFactorAuth.getKey(loginParams).get()
// add-next-line
val sfaKey = singleFactorAuth.connect(loginParams, this.applicationContext)
```

## New Addition: Sapphire Support

We are happy to announce that with v1, SFA Android SDK now supports the Web3Auth Sapphire networks.
Developers can now use the verifiers deployed on sapphire networks. Please check the supported
networks by the SDK.

```kotlin
public enum Web3AuthNetwork {
  MAINNET("mainnet"),
  TESTNET("testnet"),
  CYAN("cyan"),
  AQUA("aqua"),
  SAPPHIRE_DEVNET("sapphire_devnet"),
  SAPPHIRE_MAINNET("sapphire_mainnet");
}
```
