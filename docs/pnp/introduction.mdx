Web3Auth offers developers easy-to-use SDKs and predefined UX flows for quickly integrating Web3Auth instances into various platform offerings.

**There are two options for using Web3Auth on the web:**

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/):** This SDK provides a simple and modular way of implementing Web3Auth
  directly within your application. You can customize the pre-configured Web3Auth Modal UI according to your needs.

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK [`@web3auth/no-modal`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal):** This SDK implements all the Web3Auth features you need and
  allows you to use your UI with the Web3Auth SDK working behind the scenes.
