A verifier is essentially a configuration that contains information about the OAuth provider you've
chosen for your application. It acts as a bridge between Web3Auth and the OAuth provider, enabling
the Auth Network nodes to query and validate JWT tokens effectively.

## Create Verifier

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

![Custom Authentication Dashboard](/images/dashboard/custom-authentication.png)

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a page similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

Here, you can create a new verifier for your application by specifying the necessary details as per
your OAuth provider / login details.

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The name of your verifier. This is a unique identifier that will be used to reference this verifier.

### Supported Auth Provider

Once you have named your verifier, the next step is to choose the authentication provider for the
verifier. We have listed some of the providers we support. Please note, the support is not just
limited to listed porviders. If you don't find the provider you want to integrate, please feel free
to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth), or post your query on the
[Community Support Forum](https://web3auth.io/community/c/feature-request/14) and we will take care
of things from there.

#### Social Providers

#### Authentication Service Providers

Authentication Service Providers allow you to utilize certain implicit and authorization code
grants. You may also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity providers to pick other
social providers (for example, Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat, and so on) that we do not
natively support. It is important to note that you must register an app with the Authentication
Service Providers before proceeding.

The links below will help you set up the following authentication service providers:

#### Bring your own JWT Provider

There are some nuances with certain login providers, so don't hesitate to get in touch with us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/web3auth) or simply post your query on the
[Community Support Forum](https://web3auth.io/community/c/feature-request/14) and we will take care
of things from there.

## Edit Verifier

Click on the verifier or the three dots next to the verifier you wish to edit and click on
`Edit Verifier` in the dropdown.

The `Edit Verifier` page will appear with previously filled information. Make the necessary changes
and click on the `Update Verifier` button on the bottom.

## Archive Verifier

To archive a verifier from the existing list, click on the three dots next to the verifier you wish
to archive, and then select "Archive Verifier" from the dropdown.

When you archive a verifier, it will no longer be available for use in your application. However,
you can always unarchive it later from the Archive page in the dashboard.
