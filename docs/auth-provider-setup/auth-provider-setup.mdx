Setting up authentication providers within Web3Auth is a crucial step in configuring the
authentication flow for your application. This process involves creating a verifier, a unique
identifier that Web3Auth uses to interact with the OAuth provider and validate user authentication
requests. Verifiers play a critical role in ensuring secure and seamless authentication by
leveraging the Web3Auth Auth Network nodes.

## Understanding Verifiers

A verifier is essentially a configuration that contains information about the OAuth provider you've
chosen for your application. It acts as a bridge between Web3Auth and the OAuth provider, enabling
the Web3Auth Auth Network nodes to query and validate the JWT tokens effectively.

:::tip Get Started

Head over to the [**Create Verifier**](./verifiers.mdx) page to understand how to create a verifier
with Web3Auth for your application.

Web3Auth's design accommodates a variety of authentication scenarios through three primary verifier
types, each catering to different integration needs and offering distinct advantages:

### Default Verifiers

Default Verifiers are included with the Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs to simplify the process of
creating and managing verifiers. We provide default verifiers for popular social login providers
like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more. These pre-configured default verifiers are ready to use,
making it easy and quick to get started with Web3Auth.

However, it is highly recommended to create your own verifiers for your application, as they offer
more flexibility and control over the authentication flow. Some other caveats of using default
verifiers are:

- **Migration from Default Verifiers to Custom Verifiers is not possible**: Once the keys are
  assigned for a particular verifier, they cannot be changed.
- **Aggregation of the default verifier is not possible**: If you want to aggregate two/more social
  providers, like Google and Email Passwordless, you will need to create an Aggregate Verifier,
  which is not possible if you start with:
  - a Default Verifier
  - Social Login Verifiers
  - Custom Providers

### Social Login Verifiers

These verifiers make it easier to integrate popular social login options such as Google, Facebook,
Discord, Twitch, and a variety of additional social connections through Auth0. This simple approach
is particularly useful for applications using our services to manage login processes, making setup
hassle-free for both developers and users.

It's important to note that the Social Login Verifiers can also be used with your own custom login
flows. In this case, you would handle the authentication on your own server and then pass the JWT
token to Web3Auth for verification.

### Custom Verifiers

If you require more flexibility or need to incorporate authentication services or social connections
that are not directly supported within Web3Auth's dashboard, you can create a custom verifiers.
Whether you have your own backend authentication system or you're connecting to social login
providers that don't return an idToken, custom verifiers allow you to manually configure your
authentication flow. This setup is particularly beneficial for applications that integrate federated
identity providers such as Firebase, AWS Cognito, or Okta, and even your own custom JWT provider.
When setting up the custom verifier, you will need the JWKS Endpoint.

### Aggregate Verifiers

In the digital landscape, users often need to verify their identity using multiple login providers.
However, if you have to use multiple logins, you'll need to create multiple verifiers. The
[wallet generated for each user is specific to a verifier](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#verifier).
This means that different keys will be returned for different login methods.

To address this issue, aggregate verifiers allow for a unified identity across different login
mechanisms. For example, combining Google and Email Passwordless logins under a single verifier
ensures that users receive the same private key regardless of the login method they choose. These
login methods should share the same unique identifier, such as an email or username, that is
specific to the user.

This process involves creating an aggregate verifier, followed by sub-verifiers for each login
method.

:::tip

- It is advisable to create an `Aggregate Multiple Providers` verifier even if you're using just one
  login method for now. This will help you in the future if you want to add more login methods to
  use the [**Aggregate Verifier**](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier) feature of Web3Auth in
  your application.
- This is because we can't migrate from a single verifier(Social/Custom login methods) to an
  aggregate verifier without changing the wallet addresses.

## Setting Up Auth with Web3Auth

Integrating an OAuth provider with Web3Auth involves a few key steps, from selecting your provider
to creating the verifier and integrating it into your application. Here's a broad overview of the
process:

1. **Select the OAuth Provider:** Choose an OAuth provider supported by Web3Auth, such as Google,
   Facebook, Twitter, or any other provider that fits your application's requirements that returns
   an id_token in JWT format.

2. **Create a Verifier:** Using the Web3Auth Dashboard, create a new verifier for your selected
   OAuth provider. This involves specifying the provider details and any additional configuration
   required by the provider.

   Once your verifier is configured, it's deployed to Web3Auth Auth Network. This deployment process
   registers your verifier, making it accessible to the Auth Network nodes for JWT token
   verification. This process generally takes around 5-10 minutes to complete.

3. **Integrate with Your Application:** Finally, integrate the verifier into your application's
   authentication flow. This typically involves utilizing Web3Auth SDKs and specifying the verifier
   details in your application's authentication setup.

## Supported Auth Providers

### Social Connections

### Authentication Service Providers

Authentication Service Providers allow you to utilize certain implicit and authorization code
grants. You may also use social providers on top of Federated / Identity providers to pick other
social providers (for example, Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat, and so on) that we do not
natively support. It is important to note that you must register an app with the Authentication
Service Providers before proceeding.
