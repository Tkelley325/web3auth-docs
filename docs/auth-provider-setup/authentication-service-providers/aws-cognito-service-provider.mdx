AWS Cognito allows you to easily add authentication to your application. Web3Auth supports AWS
Cognito as a service provider. You can create a verifier for AWS Cognito and integrate it into your
application. This page will help you set up AWS Cognito as a service provider with Web3Auth.

Once you have set up an AWS Cognito application and the corresponding verifier in the Web3Auth
dashboard, you can use the available guides to integrate it into your project. The ability to use a
custom verifier is not restricted to specific SDKs and platforms. You can refer to our
[SDK references](/docs/sdk/) to understand how to utilize a custom verifier.
