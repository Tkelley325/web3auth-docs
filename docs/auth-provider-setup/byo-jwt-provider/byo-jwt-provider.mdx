You can incorporate your login providers by utilizing one of the custom login schemes, including RSA
or ECDSA signatures. By doing so, your users can continue using your current login providers or your
custom authentication scheme.

:::note

Access to Custom Authentication with your own custom JWT Provider is gated. The minimum
[pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to create custom
[verifiers](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) is the **Growth Plan**. However, you can use this
feature for projects on `sapphire_devnet` for free.

:::

:::warning

Custom JWT authentication is not supported with
[`Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal SDK`](/sdk/pnp/web/modal/) since the Web3Auth PnP Modal SDK will only
help you configure the social logins within the Modal UI.

:::

For signing the JWT, your application must follow the JWT specification and use the private key
corresponding to the JWKS. And the public keys of the JWT should be exposed through an endpoint,
which is used by Web3Auth to verify the JWT.

## Set up Custom JWT Verifier

![Custom JWT Provider on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier-custom-jwt.png)

To create a custom verifier for your JWT Providers, you'll need

1. **JWT Verifier ID**: JWT Verifier ID is the unique identifier to publicly represent a user on a
   verifier. e.g: `sub`, `email`, or even a custom field of your JWT payload that is unique in your
   system for each user.

2. **JWK Endpoint**: An endpoint containing the JWKS used for signing the JWT.

   Check [What are JWKS and How to create one from PEM](#what-are-jwks) to learn how to create JWKS.

   ```json title="Your JWKS must have the following fields."
   {
     "keys": [
       {
         "kty": "RSA",
         "kid": "{your_kid}",
         "use": "sig",
         "alg": "RS256",
         "n": "{your_n}",
         "e": "{your_e}"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **JWT Validations**

   :::warning

   Your JWT header must contain the `kid` field and the payload data must contain the `iat` field.

   :::

   You can add up to 3 validation fields, including any claims like `aud`, `sub`, `iss`,
   `email_verified` etc. These are the claims against which a JWT is validated.

   Here are a couple of examples to be used in validation:

   - Token Audience ( `aud` ): The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients for which the
     JWT is intended. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value
     in the audience claim. If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself with a
     value in the "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the JWT will be rejected. The `aud`
     value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. The interpretation of audience
     values is generally application-specific.

   - Token Issuer ( `iss` ): The issuing authority of the token. The `iss` value is a case-sensitive
     string containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

   - Token Subject ( `sub` ): The subject of the token. The `sub` value is a case-sensitive string
     containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

   - Token Email Verified ( `email_verified` ): The email verified claim is a boolean value that
     indicates whether the email address has been verified.

### Generate JWT

To generate the JWT, you can choose package of your choice. We have documented few of the well known
packages.

- [Generate JWT using jsonwebtoken](/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/jsonwebtoken)
- [Generate JWT using jose](/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/jose)
- [Generate JWT using passport-jwt](/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider/passport-jwt)

### Login with JWT

Once you have setup JWKS, and created Custom JWT verifier in Web3Auth dashboard, you can follow the
below example to use it with No Modal SDK.

```tsx title="No Modal Example"
import { AuthAdapter } from "@web3auth/auth-adapter";

// Create AuthAdapter instance once you have created Web3AuthNoModal instance
const authAdapter = new AuthAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    uxMode: "redirect", // redirect or popup
    loginConfig: {
      // focus-start
      jwt: {
        verifier: "verifier-name", // Name of the verifier created on Web3Auth Dashboard
        typeOfLogin: "jwt",
        clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // Web3Auth Client ID
      },
      // focus-end
    },
  },
});

await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
  // focus-start
  loginProvider: "jwt",
  extraLoginOptions: {
    id_token: "YOUR_GENERATED_ID_TOKEN",
    verifierIdField: "sub", // sub, email, or custom
  },
  // focus-end
});
```

## What are JWKS?

JWKS stands for JSON Web Key Set. It is a set of keys containing the public keys that should be used
to verify any JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by the authorization server and signed using the RS256
signing algorithm.

### How to create JWKS?

- Most of the login providers that support JWT-based login will provide you this URL, such as
  Firebase, Google, Auth0, AWS Cognito etc.

  - Firebase: `https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/{your-project-id}`
  - Auth0: `https://{your-domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  - Google: `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`
  - AWS Cognito: `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`

- If you are using your own custom JWT, you will need to convert your PEM file to JWKS.

### How to convert PEM to JWKS?

If you're using `jose` or `jsonwebtoken` library, you can use the following steps to convert your
PEM file to JWKS.

1. Create a Private Key using openssl.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out privateKey.pem 2048
   ```

   This privateKey will be used to sign the token.

2. Using the above privateKey.pem file, create a Public Key.

   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in privateKey.pem -pubout -out publicKey.pem
   ```

   This publicKey.pem file will be converted to JWKS.

3. Convert the publicKey.pem file to JWKS.

   Now, look for a tool that converts `.pem` to `jwk(s)` format.

   - One of the tools is https://pem2jwk.vercel.app/
     - Select Signing Algorithm: `RS256`
     - Select Public Key Use: `Signing`
     - Key ID: `paste-yours` or leave it blank to generate a random one.
     - PEM encoded key: `{paste-the-publicKey-pem-file-s-content-here}`
   - Click on the `Convert to JWK` button.

     ![JWKS Convert Tool](https://web3auth.io/community/uploads/default/optimized/2X/3/3e58a3b7378b9778b0b2d646ec2a3cf47c56ee5e_2_690x448.jpeg)

4. To complete the process, you need to save the output as a `.json` file, host it on your server,
   and make sure it's publicly accessible.

   This will give you the `JWKS Endpoint`, which is required when setting up a `Custom JWT Verifier`
   on the Web3Auth Dashboard.
